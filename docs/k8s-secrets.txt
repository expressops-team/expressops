# HOW Secret Management Works 

ExpressOps ==> Kubernetes + External Secrets Operator to securely manage secrets across namespaces.


1. All original secrets (like the Slack webhook) are stored in a central namespace called app-secrets

2. The External Secrets Operator is configured to read those secrets and copy them into the namespace where each app runs

3. Each app then reads the copied secret from its **own namespace**, typically by using environment variables

This  means:
secrets in one place  
ESO takes care of syncing them  
Apps stay decoupled from secret storage logic
