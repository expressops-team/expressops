- `LOG_LEVEL`: Set logging level (info, debug, warn, error)
- `LOG_FORMAT`: Set logging format (text, json)
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: Required for Slack notifications

## üîç Getting Help

The Makefile includes a comprehensive help system with information about available commands and configuration options.

Here are the main help commands you can use:

- `make help` - Shows you everything you can do with ExpressOps
- `make quick-help` - Just the essential commands you'll use most often 
- `make about` - Learn what ExpressOps is and how to get started
- `make config` - See all your current settings and how to change them

These commands display information in a paged format (similar to 'more' or 'less'). Press 'q' to exit the view.

The help system is organized into categories:
- Development commands (build, run)
- Docker commands (build, push, run)
- Kubernetes commands (deploy, status, logs)
- Helm commands (install, upgrade, uninstall)

![Make QuickHelp Command](docs/img/help.png)

**IMPORTANT:** The help commands are your best source of information about deployment options and required environment variables.

## üóùÔ∏è Secret Management

ExpressOps uses External Secrets Operator with Google Cloud Secret Manager for secure secret management:

### How Secrets Work in ExpressOps

1. **GCP Secret Manager**: Stores the secrets in Google Cloud
   - Secret Name: `slack-webhook`
   - Project ID: `fc-it-school-2025`
   - Full Path: `projects/88527591198/secrets/slack-webhook`

2. **ClusterSecretStore**: Configures access to GCP Secret Manager
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
   kind: ClusterSecretStore
   metadata:
     name: expressops-external-secrets
   spec:
     provider:
       gcpsm:
         projectID: fc-it-school-2025
         auth:
           secretRef:
             secretAccessKeySecretRef:
               name: gcp-secret-creds
               key: sa.json
   ```

3. **ExternalSecret**: Fetches the secret from GCP Secret Manager
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
   kind: ExternalSecret
   metadata:
     name: expressops-slack-external-secret
   spec:
     refreshInterval: "1h"
     secretStoreRef:
       name: expressops-external-secrets
       kind: ClusterSecretStore
     target:
       name: expressops-slack-secret
       creationPolicy: Owner
     data:
       - secretKey: SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
         remoteRef:
           key: projects/88527591198/secrets/slack-webhook
           version: "latest"
   ```

4. **Deployment**: References the created Kubernetes secret
   ```yaml
   env:
     - name: SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
       valueFrom:
         secretKeyRef:
           name: expressops-slack-secret
           key: SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
   ```

### Deploying with GCP Secret Manager

The recommended way to deploy with GCP Secret Manager is using one of these commands:

```bash
# Make sure key.json (GCP service account credentials) is in the project root
# This file allows access to the GCP Secret Manager

# Complete setup with External Secrets Operator and GCP Secret Manager
make setup-with-gcp-credentials

# Or deploy using Helm with GCP Secret Manager
make helm-install-with-gcp-secrets

# Alternative: Deploy directly to Kubernetes with GCP Secret Manager
make k8s-deploy-with-gcp-secretstore
```

This approach keeps your secrets secure by:
- Storing them in Google Cloud Secret Manager
- Using service account authentication
- Creating Kubernetes secrets automatically via External Secrets Operator
- Never exposing sensitive values in your code or configuration files

## üõ•Ô∏è Kubernetes Deployment

ExpressOps can be deployed to Kubernetes using the provided Makefile commands:

```bash
# Connect to Kubernetes (keep this terminal open)
gcloud compute ssh --zone "europe-west1-d" "it-school-2025-1" --tunnel-through-iap --project "fc-it-school-2025" --ssh-flag "-N -L 6443:127.0.0.1:6443"

# Install External Secrets Operator (first time setup)
make k8s-install-eso

# Build, tag and push Docker image to Docker Hub (optional)
# The deployment is already configured to use davidnull/expressops:1.0.0
# You can change the version by setting the VERSION variable:
# VERSION=1.0.1 make docker-push
make docker-push

# Set SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL environment variable before deployment (required)
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/REAL/TOKEN"

# Deploy to Kubernetes with secrets
make k8s-deploy-with-clustersecretstore

# Check deployment status
make k8s-status

# Forward port to access the application
make k8s-port-forward

# View logs
make k8s-logs

# Delete deployment
make k8s-delete
```

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080 after port forwarding.

## üìä Monitoring

ExpressOps includes comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana:

### Key Metrics

- CPU and memory usage
- Plugin execution latency
- Success/failure rates
- HTTP request counts
- Storage utilization

### Setup Monitoring

```bash
# Install Prometheus
make prometheus-install PROMETHEUS_NAMESPACE=monitoring-david

# Install Grafana
make grafana-install PROMETHEUS_NAMESPACE=monitoring-david GRAFANA_RELEASE=grafana-david

# Access Prometheus UI
make local-prometheus-port-forward PROMETHEUS_NAMESPACE=monitoring-david PROMETHEUS_PORT=9091

# Access Grafana UI
make grafana-port-forward PROMETHEUS_NAMESPACE=monitoring-david GRAFANA_RELEASE=grafana-david GRAFANA_PORT=3001
```

Default Grafana credentials: admin/admin123

### Dashboard Setup

Use the included development dashboard to monitor ExpressOps performance:

```bash
# Deploy the dashboard to Grafana
./deploy-dashboard.sh
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration example

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: slack-notifier
    path: plugins/slack/slack.so
    type: notification
    config:
      webhook_url: $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL

flows:
  - name: alert-flow
    pipeline:
      - pluginRef: health-check-plugin
      - pluginRef: formatter-plugin
      - pluginRef: slack-notifier
```

## üß™ Example Flow: dr-house

This flow performs:

1. System health check
2. Formats the result
3. Prints a test message

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/flow?flowName=dr-house&format=verbose"
```


## üîç Flow Discovery

ExpressOps provides a built-in flow to discover all available flows in the system:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/flow?flowName=all-flows"
```

This will return a formatted list of all flows with their descriptions and plugins. The `all-flows` output is:

- Automatically displayed in full without truncation
- Formatted with each flow appearing on separate log lines in Kubernetes logs for better readability
- A great way to explore available flows when you're first getting started

When running in Kubernetes, you can view the formatted output with:

```bash
make k8s-port-forward  # In terminal 1
curl "http://localhost:8080/flow?flowName=all-flows"  # In terminal 2
make k8s-logs  # In terminal 3 to see the nicely formatted logs
```

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue, fork the repo, or submit a pull request.

Please follow the convention of exporting your plugin as PluginInstance, and ensure it implements the Plugin interface:
```go
type Plugin interface {
    Initialize(ctx context.Context, config map[string]interface{}, logger *logrus.Logger) error
    Execute(ctx context.Context, request *http.Request, shared *map[string]any) (interface{}, error)
    FormatResult(result interface{}) (string, error)
}
```
